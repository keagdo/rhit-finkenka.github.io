            <p>Hi! I'm Keagan Finkenbine. I am a senior mechanical engineering student with a minor in computer science at Rose-Hulman!</p>
            <p>I am interested in going to graduate school, and furthering my learning. In grad school, I hope to either go into mechanical engineering or computer science as they are both facinating topics. Ideally though, I would get the opertunity to combine the two in something like Robotics.</p>
